  <b>June 30, 2011.</b>  
  We have started a <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/mymedialite">Google Group for MyMediaLite</a>.
  Join the group to ask questions about MyMediaLite, get announcement of new versions, and discuss
  the library's future development with us.
  </p>

  <a name="1.03"><h2>MyMediaLite 1.03</h2></a>  
    <p>
    <b>June 22, 2011.</b>
    Version 1.03 of MyMediaLite has been released. There are many new features:
    <ul>
      <li>A prototype SOAP web service for rating prediction. We plan to offer most of MyMediaLite's functionality using RESTful services in the future.</li>
      <li>New recommenders: FactorWiseMatrixFactorization, BiasMatrixFactorizationMAE</li>
      <li>Simplified interfaces IRatingPrediction and IItemRecommender</li>
      <li>The library (and the command-line tools) now also offer an online evaluation protocol that uses incremental updates.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Important announcement:
    <b>This may be the last version to support Mono 2.6. If you use MyMediaLite and rely on running it on Mono 2.6,
       please tell us so that we can figure out how you will be able to run future versions of MML.</b>

  <a name="1.0"><h2>MyMediaLite 1.0</h2></a>  
    <p>
    <b>March 19, 2011.</b>
    Version 1.0 has been released. It features major changes in the
    API and in the way the ratings/user feedback is stored internally.
    This makes it feasible to load big datasets like the ones from
    <a href="http://kddcup.yahoo.com">KDD Cup 2011</a> into main memory.
    We also ship extra code and a command-line program to handle the KDD Cup data,
    and some example Python scripts.

  <a name="0.11"><h2>MyMediaLite 0.11</h2></a>  
    <p>
    <b>March 4, 2011.</b>
    Version 0.11 has been released. It features a simple Gtk#-based demo of some
    of the library's functionality. Feedback and improvements are very welcome,
    as we are not GUI specialists (yet).
    There have been the following improvements:
    <ul>
      <li>SlopeOne is now much faster and consumes less memory.</li>
      <li>We fixed some bugs in the incremental update functionality of the matrix
          factorization recommenders.</li>
      <li>We now support the MovieLens 1M/10M ratings format.</li>
    </ul>

  <a name="0.10"><h2>MyMediaLite 0.10</h2></a>  
    <p>
    <b>February 9, 2011.</b>
    Version 0.10 has been on the server since <a href="http://fosdem.org/2011">FOSDEM</a>, so this announcement is a little bit late.
    There have been several improvements:
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="[% prefix %]documentation/command_line.html">command-line tools</a> now use reflection to automagically find all relevant recommenders.
          This means you do not have to modify the command-line tools any more to use your newly implemented recommenders!</li>
      <li>The kNN-based methods are now faster and consume less memory because they take data sparsity better into account.</li>
      <li>A method for the diversification of result sets has been added to the experimental section of MyMediaLite.</li>
      <li>Some namespaces and types have been renamed to have nicer, more intuitive names.</li>
    </ul>

  <a name="0.09"><h2>MyMediaLite 0.09 has been released</h2></a>
  <p>
    <b>January 12, 2011.</b>
    As always, this is the best version of MyMediaLite ever.
    The most notable changes are support for reading data from SQL databases (and other
    data sources supporting the <code>IDataReader</code> interface), the addition of the
    <em>Slope One</em> rating predictor, and initial support for crossvalidation.

    There have been several changes:
    Most notably, we now have the API documentation
    in the packages and on the website.
    Another programmer-visible change is that our namespaces now have <code>CamelCase</code>
    instead of <code>lower_case</code> names.

  <a name="camra"><h2>MyMediaLite successfully used in live evaluation</h2></a>
  <p>
    <b>September 30, 2010.</b>
    MyMediaLite developers [% INCLUDE link link='zeno' %]
    and
    [% INCLUDE link link='steffen' %],
    supervised by
    <a href="../personen/lst_en.html">Lars Schmidt-Thieme</a>,
    received two awards at the
    <em>
     <a href="http://www.dai-labor.de/camra2010/challenge-winners/">
     Context-aware Movie Recommendation Challenge (CAMRa),
     </a>
    </em>
    which was held at the <a href="http://recsys.acm.org/2010/">ACM Conference on Recommender Systems</a>
    in Barcelona.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Goal of the challenge was to recommend
    individual movies for visitors of the
    <a href="http://www.moviepilot.de/">moviepilot.de</a> website
    in a certain period, e.g. the Christmas week.
    In the 'Live Evaluation' track,
    the quality of the recommendations was judged by
    <a href="http://www.moviepilot.de/">moviepilot.de</a> users after watching the movies.
    This is in contrast to the usual evaluation in such challenges,
    which is often based on simulated users and records of past user behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    The method used for the 'Live Evaluation' track was the MyMediaLite recommender
    <a href="http://gitorious.org/mymedialite/mymedialite/blobs/master/Algorithms/item_recommender/BPRMF.cs">BPR-MF</a>,
    matrix factorization optimized for Bayesian Personalized Ranking, described in
    <a href="../../pub/pdfs/Rendle_et_al2009-Bayesian_Personalized_Ranking.pdf">this UAI 2009 paper</a>.
