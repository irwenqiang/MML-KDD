  <h2>API Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    We offer MyMediaLite's API documentation in two flavours:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="mdoc/index.html">generated by Mono's <tt>mdoc</tt> tool</a>,</li>
      <li><a href="doxygen/index.html">generated by Doxygen</a>, and</li>
    </ul>
    Time will tell which one we'll stick with.
    Contact us to give feedback on the API documentation.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
  
  <h3>What are the differences between MyMediaLite and the [% INCLUDE link link='mymediaframework' %]?</h3>
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>MyMediaLite is free and open source software, published under the terms of GPLv3, whereas
        the MyMedia Framework is only available for non-commercial uses.</li>
    <li>MyMediaLite is, as the name says, leaner and simpler and carries less overhead, in particular:
       <ul>
         <li>it does not require a database</li>
         <li>it contains a different set of recommender algorithms (even though there is big overlap)</li>
         <li>it does not contain advanced features such as complex recommenders, recommender flows, OpenID integration, etc.</li>
       </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  
  <h3>I found a bug. Where can I report it?</h3>
  <p>
    <p>Send an e-mail to [% INCLUDE link link='email' %].</p>
    <p>Please tell us which version of MyMediaLite you use,
       and describe in detail how to reproduce the bug,
       and include your data with the report (if possible).
  </p>

  <h3>Item recommender evaluation is quite slow. What can I do to speed it up?</h3>
  <p>
  Evaluation using measures like <a href="http://recsyswiki.com/wiki/Area_under_the_ROC_curve">AUC</a>
  or <a href="http://recsyswiki.com/wiki/Precision_and_Recall">precision</a> requires, at least for many recommenders,
  computing the scores for all user-item combination.
  This means evaluation can take some time, even if you have a fast recommender.
  If evaluation takes too much time, you can consider reducing the number of candidate items,
  or the number of users.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <a href="item_prediction.html">item prediction command line tool</a> offers the options
  <tt>--relevant-items=FILE</tt> and <tt>--relevant-users=FILE</tt> for this purpose.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Is MyMediaLite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_safety">thread-safe</a>?</h3>
  <p>
  No, the MyMediaLite core library is generally not thread-safe.
  If you use MyMediaLite in a multi-threading scenario, you need to make sure that
  write access to data structures and recommender models (e.g. training) as properly synchronized.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <tt>Predict()</tt> method <it>is</it> thread-safe because it does not write any data.
  The example web service included with MyMediaLite can be called from more than one client at once
  because all method calls that write data are properly synchronized.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What can I do to make MyMediaLite consume less memory?</h3>
  <p>
  Depending on your application, you can use datatypes that use less memory,
  e.g.
  <tt><a href="doxygen/class_my_media_lite_1_1_data_1_1_static_byte_ratings.html">StaticByteRatings</a></tt>,
  <tt><a href="doxygen/class_my_media_lite_1_1_data_1_1_static_float_ratings.html">StaticFloatRatings</a></tt>
  for rating prediction, or
  <tt><a href="doxygen/class_my_media_lite_1_1_data_type_1_1_sparse_boolean_matrix_binary_search.html">PosOnlyFeedback&lt;SparseBooleanMatrixBinarySearch&gt;</a></tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you use the <a href="rating_prediction.html">rating prediction command-line tool</a>,
  you may use the <tt>--rating-type=byte|float|double</tt> argument.
  </p>
