    There are many different ways in which you can contribute to the development of MyMediaLite.
   </p>

   <h2>Use it and tell us about it</h2>
   <p>
     First of all, if you use MyMediaLite, <a href="contact.html">tell us</a> for what you use it, and what you like (and what not) about it.
     This helps us to determine the future directions of MyMediaLite.
   </p>
   <p>
     You have an idea how to make the API or the command-line tools more usable? Tell us!
   </p>
   
   <h2>Report bugs</h2>
   <p>
   If something does not work, please tell us so.
   Maybe it is easy to fix.
   </p>
   <p>
   Even better, if you fix it yourself ...
   </p>
   
   <h2>Send us bugfixes</h2>
   <p>
   If you fixed a bug, send us the patch so that the other users of MyMediaLite can also profit from your work.
   </p>
   
   <h2>Enhance MyMediaLite</h2>
   <p>
   If something is missing in MyMediaLite, why not implement it?
   It may be better than waiting for someone else to do it.
   MyMediaLite's APIs are designed to be usable, and the whole library is <a href="documentation/index.html">well-documented</a>.
   If you have questions, do not hesitate to contact us.
   We are happy to accept your contributions.
   </p>
   <p>Possible extensions are:

     <li>new recommendation tasks</li>
     <li>IO code for new data formats</li>

   </p>
